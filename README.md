# âœ¨ Tiny Decisions â€“ A Personal Decision Log

Ever feel stuck between a few options and wish you could look back at how you made choices before?  
*Tiny Decisions* is a lightweight little tool I built to help log personal decisions â€” big or small â€” along with the thinking that went into them.

Itâ€™s like a journal for your thought process. Great for overthinkers like me ðŸ˜…

- Log decisions you're thinking about
- Add optional pros and cons
- Mark whether you're still deciding or already made your choice
- Add reasoning and reflections when you're done
- Keeps a history of everything (locally in your browser)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Plain HTML + CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Data is stored with localStorage (so it's just for you â€” no backend,Â noÂ server)
